# 🎮 Connect 4 - Matplotlib Edition

A fun, click-based version of the classic **Connect 4** game — built entirely in **Python** using `matplotlib`, and backed by clean modular logic.

Forget boring terminal games — this one's got a full GUI, animations, and that satisfying dropping effect. Built with love, logic, and a dash of Verstappen energy. 🏁

## 🧠 How It Works

- **`matplotlib_game.py`**: Displays the game board using `matplotlib`, handles mouse clicks, and animates the falling pieces.
